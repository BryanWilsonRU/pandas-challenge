Homework #4- Pandas

Three conclusions based on the data:
1. The first conclusion I can draw based on the data in this assignment is that this game's demographic is overwhelmingly male, with about 84% of players being males. One way that I think this game could grow its user/player base would be to make some gameplay or marketing adjustments to try to attract more female players. 

2. The second conclusion that I would make is that the vast majority of the player of Heroes of Pymoli fall in the age group of 15-29, and they make up a large portion of the purchases of in-game items. This could allow the developers to target their ads to people within this age group to grow their player base; alternatively, they could target ads at younger or older players if their goal was to increase age diversity of their players.

3. The third and final conclusion I can see based on the data is that the item, "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" is both the most popular item sold, as well as the most profitable item. One thing that might be valuable to the developers of the game would be for them to look into why it's so popular- and so profitable. It could be useful to them if and when they decide to update the game and add additional items, in order to create a demand for those new items, and while ensuring that they don't add  an item that is so rare/coveted that it becomes outrageously expensive.
